# css zen garden
 
Digital Media class assignment, in which we had to use the default HTML file from csszengarden.com, and style it using vanilla CSS.

Directions: No altering the HTML whatsoever. No CSS pre-processors or scripts. Must be fully responsive.

Note: because of the no-Javascript-or-SASS restriction, the background animation had to be done using CSS animation and a good ol' PNG. Depending on your machine, your CPU/RAM might start to get a little overexcited. So, please remember to close the tab when you're finished, and thank your motherboard for doing such a great job.
