#### Assignment for my Digital Media class, in which we had to use the default HTML file from [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com), and style it using vanilla CSS.

**Rules:** 
- No altering the HTML whatsoever. 
- No CSS pre-processors or scripts. 
- Must be fully responsive.
- No found images or icons.


*Note: because of the no-Javascript-or-SASS restriction, the background animation had to be done using CSS animation and a big ol' PNG. Depending on your machine, your CPU/RAM might start to get a little overexcited. So, please remember to close the tab when you're finished, and thank your motherboard for doing such a great job.*
