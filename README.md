#### Assignment for my university Digital Media class, in which we had to use the default HTML file from [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com), and style it using vanilla CSS.

**Rules:** 
- No altering the HTML. 
- No CSS processors or scripts. 
- Must be responsive.
- No found images or icons.
