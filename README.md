# css zen garden
 
#### Digital Media class assignment, in which we had to use the default HTML file from [Css Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com), and style it using vanilla CSS.

**Directions:** 
- No altering the HTML whatsoever. 
- No CSS pre-processors or scripts. 
- Must be fully responsive.

*Note: because of the no-Javascript-or-SASS restriction, the background animation had to be done using CSS animation and a big ol' PNG. Depending on your machine, your CPU/RAM might start to get a little overexcited. So, please remember to close the tab when you're finished, and thank your motherboard for doing such a great job.*
